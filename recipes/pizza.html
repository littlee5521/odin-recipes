    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be a
      snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be devoured
      alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one below is the
      classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 inch) soft flour tortilla</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 cooked chicken breast, sliced</li>
      <li>½ green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>2 green onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>⅓ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        Place tortilla on a baking sheet. Brush with olive oil; sprinkle garlic
        powder, salt, and pepper on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the
        oven and spread tomato sauce on top; arrange chicken breast, green bell
        pepper, and green onions over tomato sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.
        Sprinkle oregano over cheese. Slice pizza into wedges using a pizza
        cutter.
